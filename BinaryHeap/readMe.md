All our code is in the BinHeap.cpp. Screenshots of the project running and what is output are in the folder labeled BinHeap Screenshots. The first word is Xunantunich, an ancient Mayan archaeological site. The next word is Samhainophobia, the fear of Halloween. The third output alphebetizes the letters when ran. The last word is agathokakologic, an adjective describing something as containing good and evil.
